 ## Database Design
 
 Design a relational database schema with appropriate tables, primary and foreign keys. Define relationships between tables. Example tables:- `Customers` (customer_id, name, email, address, etc.)- `Orders` (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, etc.)- `Products` (product_id, name, price, category, etc.)- `Transactions` (transaction_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, amount, etc.)
 
 ## Data Import
 
 Import the e-commerce dataset into your MySQL database. Use tools like MySQL Workbench or command line tools to execute SQL statements for table creation and data import.
 
 ## Tools 
  - SQL
  - Power bi
  - 
 ## Data Exploration Queries
 Write SQL queries to explore and understand the dataset.
 Examples
 1. List top-selling products.
 2. Find the total revenue generated.
 3. Identify the most valuable customers.
 4. Calculate the average order value.
 5. Break down the total revenue by month.
 6. Retrieve the purchase history for a specific customer.
 7. Identify the top product categories by total revenue.
 8. Count the number of repeat customers.
 9. Calculate the customer churn rate.
 10. Find the most popular products in a specific category.
 11. Identify products that haven't been sold in the last three months.
 12. Calculate the average transaction value for each customer.
 13. Determine the percentage of total revenue contributed by the top 10 customers.
 14. Identify the days with the highest number of sales.
 15. Calculate the average number of products included in each order.
 ## Performance Optimization
 Optimise your queries for better performance. Use indexing, analyse query execution plans, and
 suggest improvements.
 Customer Segmentation
 Create SQL queries to segment customers based on their purchase behaviour. Example segments:
- New customers- Repeat customers- High-value customers
 Time Series Analysis
 Analyse sales trends over time. Use SQL to calculate monthly or quarterly revenue, identify peak
 sales periods, and observe any seasonality.
 Product Analysis
 Perform analysis on products. Examples:- Identify best-selling products by category.- Find products with declining sales.- Determine the average order size.
 Data Visualization
 Integrate data visualisation tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to create visual representations of your
 SQL analysis.

## Recommendations 
1.	Focus on Top-Selling Products: Increase inventory and marketing efforts for top-selling products to maximize revenue.
2.	Customer Retention Strategies: Implement loyalty programs and personalized offers to reduce churn rate.
3.	Optimize Sales Days: Launch targeted promotions on days with historically high sales to boost revenue.
4.	Diversify Product Categories: Explore opportunities to introduce new products in underperforming categories.
